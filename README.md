Exploring Wikipedia's list of the largest cruise ships

A couple tables of data on the largest cruise ships can be found on Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cruise_ships. This includes a list of ships that are in service as well as a list of ships that are on-order. 

The several columns found in these tables allow for exploring this topic from multiple angles. For example, taking a look at the information as it relates to each cruise line and the year ships were built.
